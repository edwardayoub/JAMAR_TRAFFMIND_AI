# TraffMind AI JAMAR Portal V1.2

Released on June 17, 2024, Version 1.2 of the TraffMind AI JAMAR Portal introduces significant improvements and new features to our advanced video traffic analysis platform. This version builds on the strengths of previous releases and adds powerful tools to enhance traffic data analysis and urban mobility management.

### **1- Enhanced Detector, Classifier, and GPU Processing**

- **Application**: Offers iterative improvements to detection and classification algorithms, combined with a transition to GPU processors for faster processing. This enhancement ensures that traffic data is analyzed with greater accuracy and speed.
- **Technology**: The enhanced detector and classifier use state-of-the-art deep learning models that have been trained on extensive datasets to improve the detection and classification of vehicles. These models are now processed on powerful GPU servers, which significantly reduce the time required for analysis. The system can handle up to 10 processing jobs in parallel, increasing overall efficiency and allowing for real-time traffic data processing.

### **2- Vector Counter**

- **Application**: Allows users to draw lines defining the turning movements they are interested in. This feature is particularly useful for traffic engineers and urban planners who need to analyze specific turning movements at intersections to optimize traffic flow.
- **Technology**: The Vector Counter utilizes advanced graphical interfaces that enable users to draw and customize vectors directly on the traffic footage. These vectors are then used to identify and count turning movements, providing precise data for traffic studies. The system is highly adaptable, allowing for adjustments in vector placement and settings to meet various analytical needs.

### **3- Improved Upload Solution**

- **Application**: This feature addresses and resolves previous upload bugs by implementing an improved upload solution using SFTP with AWS S3. Users can now experience a smoother and more reliable upload process, eliminating the frustrations and limitations encountered with earlier versions.
- **Technology**: The new upload solution leverages the secure and scalable capabilities of SFTP integrated with AWS S3 storage. This combination ensures data integrity and security while allowing users to easily drag and drop their files for upload. The system is designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently, providing a robust and user-friendly experience.

### **4- Quality Control Assurance**

- **Application**: Ensures the accuracy and reliability of automated systems through manual verification. By processing over 250 hours of real job footage and manually counting 15 minutes of each location, this feature provides a high level of confidence in the system's automated counts.
- **Technology**: The quality control process involves a meticulous manual verification procedure where trained analysts count vehicles manually on selected footage. This data is then compared with the automated counts to identify and correct discrepancies. This rigorous approach ensures that the system maintains high accuracy standards and builds trust among users regarding the reliability of the data provided.

TraffMind AI JAMAR Portal V1.2 introduces critical enhancements and new features that significantly improve traffic data analysis capabilities. By building on the robust foundation of previous versions, V1.2 provides a more reliable, efficient, and detailed traffic management toolset, empowering users to derive actionable insights from complex traffic data.
